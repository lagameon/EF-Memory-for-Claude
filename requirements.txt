# EF Memory V2 — Dependencies
# Base: Python 3.11+ stdlib only (json, sqlite3, struct, math, hashlib, difflib)
# No mandatory external dependencies.
#
# Install the provider SDKs you need:
#
# --- Embedding providers (M1) ---
#   pip install google-genai      # Gemini embeddings (primary)
#   pip install openai             # OpenAI embeddings
#   pip install ollama             # Ollama local embeddings
#
# --- LLM providers for reasoning (M6) ---
#   pip install anthropic          # Anthropic Claude (primary for reasoning)
#   pip install openai             # OpenAI GPT (also used for reasoning)
#   pip install google-genai       # Google Gemini (also used for reasoning)
#   pip install ollama             # Ollama local LLMs (also used for reasoning)
#
# All SDKs are optional — the system gracefully degrades:
#   - Without embedding SDKs: search falls back to keyword/basic mode
#   - Without LLM SDKs: reasoning uses heuristic-only mode
